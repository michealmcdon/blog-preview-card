## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts. I found it useful to adjust card elements to ensure they scale well on different devices.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my understanding of advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript for dynamic content manipulation. I also plan to explore accessibility best practices more thoroughly.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This resource helped me understand how to implement Flexbox layouts effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - A comprehensive guide that clarified many of the grid properties I used in this project.
